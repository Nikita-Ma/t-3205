# TEST TASK 3205


## Install & Settings

* nodejs >= 18.14.0

```
cd client  // install client packages
npm install
cd ..
cd server // install server packages
npm install 
```

* Add your postgres database (watch .env file)
* DUMP.sql (execute commands)
* ``~t-3205/server | npm run dev // run server``
* ``~t-3205/cleint | npm run start // run client``

## TODO

* use concurrently
* update server guard
* add linters and interment settings (.editorconfig etc.)

### p.s

* I used guard in backend and frontend because:
    * a) In Frontend based on basic UX. User will should great & simple understand our application
    * b) In Backend based on our security, but some advanced users may use other services for request on our server.
    We must protect him.
### p.p.s 
* I haven't slept for a day and maybe I'll be ashamed of my code

Thank you!

Happy hacking and Have a nice day! 🍀
